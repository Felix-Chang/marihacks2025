## üöÄ Project Overview

Truthly is a Chrome extension that empowers users to combat misinformation in real-time. By simply highlighting suspicious claims on any webpage, users receive instant fact-checking with credible sources - making truth verification as easy as copy and paste.

Built during a 24-hour hackathon, Truthly addresses the growing challenge of misinformation in our digital age, particularly during elections and major news events.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Fact-Checking**: Highlight any text on a webpage to instantly verify claims
- **Credible Sources of Information**: Multiple links available for further reading
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages Perplexity API for intelligent verification
- **Source Attribution**: Provides credible, linked sources for all fact-checks
- **Lightweight Design**: Fast, intuitive interface that doesn't disrupt browsing
- **Context-Aware**: Handles nuanced claims and provides contextual analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Integration**: Perplexity API (Sonar model)
- **Development Tools**: Cursor AI for rapid prototyping
- **Platform**: Chrome Extension API
- **Architecture**: Client-side processing with API integration

## üë• My Contributions & Leadership

As **Team Lead** for this project, I:

- **Project Management**: Coordinated a multi-person team, divided tasks strategically, and maintained project timeline under 24-hour constraint
- **Frontend Development**: Designed and implemented the user interface and user experience
- **JavaScript Architecture**: Built core functionality for text highlighting, API integration, and real-time fact-checking
- **Quality Assurance**: Led debugging efforts and error resolution throughout development
- **Technical Decision-Making**: Chose technology stack and architectural patterns for optimal performance

## üéØ Technical Challenges Solved

- **Prompt Engineering**: Developed sophisticated prompts for the Sonar model, discovering how minute wording changes drastically affected API accuracy
- **Chrome Extension Architecture**: Learned and implemented Chrome extension APIs from scratch during the hackathon
- **Ambiguous Content Handling**: Created logic to handle vague or context-dependent claims
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for speed while maintaining accuracy in fact-checking results
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented efficient API usage patterns to work within constraints

## üèóÔ∏è Development Process

Built in just 24 hours using an agile approach:
1. **Ideation**: Identified misinformation as a critical social problem
2. **MVP Planning**: Focused on core fact-checking functionality
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Used Cursor AI to accelerate initial development
4. **Iterative Testing**: Continuous testing and refinement of accuracy
5. **Polish**: Enhanced UI/UX for intuitive user experience

## üåü Impact & Recognition

- **First Place Winner** among 50+ competing teams
- Demonstrated practical application of AI for social good
- Created accessible tool for non-technical users to verify information

## ü§ù Team Collaboration

This project showcased effective teamwork under pressure, combining diverse skills in AI integration, web development, and user experience design. Successfully managed team dynamics and task allocation to deliver a winning solution within tight constraints.
